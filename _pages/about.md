Welcome to my website and blog! I am Kartik Ramachandrula, a High School Junior at Brookfield Central High School in Brookfield, Wisconsin. 

My academic interests lie in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, and any field that involves problem-solving or creative thinking. I have been involved in Math and Physics Olympiads (USAMO & USAPhO) qualifying for the 2023 U.S. Physics Team. I am currently completing research in the 2024 MIT PRIMES-USA (Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering and Science for High School Students) cohort in scientific machine learning and will complete particle physics research at the 2024 RSI (Research Summer Institute).

I also love learning languages (Telugu and Sanskrit), history (Indology), and philosophy (Vedic or otherwise); playing Tennis and Badminton; watching Cricket; and fault-finding Tollywood and Bollywood movies.
